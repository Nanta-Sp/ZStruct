## Installation

First, clone this github repository.

Aug 2024: Attempting a reproducible build with [Pixi](https://pixi.sh), a tool built on the conda ecosystem to manage both dependencies and installation tasks. You can install pixi by following the simple installation at the above link and then test ZStruct by navigating into the ZStruct git repository and executing `pixi run start` which installs the dependencies, executes the Makefile, and if successful runs the built executable. Alternatively, the pixi.toml specifies the conda channels, dependency package names, and necessary installation tasks which you can reference and apply using your preferred tools.
